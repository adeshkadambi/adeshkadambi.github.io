> **Doctoral Researcher** / KITE Research Institute\
> *September 2020 - Present • Toronto, ON*
- My PhD research focuses on leveraging data science to improve outpatient therapy for stroke and spinal cord injury patients. I'm developing a system that uses wearable cameras, computer vision, and deep learning to provide clinicians with insights into patients' real-life hand use at home. 
- This project involves: working closely with healthcare professionals to intimately understand domain-specific challenges, [designing a dashboard](https://doi.org/10.46292/sci23-00015S) that transforms complex data into actionable insights for clinicians, and [piloting the system](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.27.24314512) with real clinicians and patients to assess its impact on decision-making and intervention planning.
